The file

    linear-algebra/math-la-topic-list.yaml

contains a reasonably complete list of topics for an introductory
course in linear algebra.  

The purpose of the list is for tagging educational resources to help
facilitate the discovery of useful material.  In order to address all
possible perspectives, the list intentionally contains mutliple
opposing viewpoints.  For example, there are two possible ways of
defining linear independence.  Once one way is chosen, then it
is a theorem that the other possibility is equivalent.  The list
contains both options as definitions, and both options as theorems.

The goal is not to give a Bourbaki-style formulation of linear algebra,
so topics are only stated with sufficient precision to allow unambiguous
tagging of videos, exercises, quizzes, sections of books, etc.

Similarly, the file

    linear-algebra/outcome-list.yaml

contains a reasonably complete list of outcomes for an introductory
course in linear algebra.

The naming schemes for topic and outcomes are given in
