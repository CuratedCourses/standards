Linear algebra topic identifiers begin
math.la

Following math.la. is one of the following letters, with the stated meaning:

a  application
c  concept
d  definition
e  example
t  theorem

The remaining entries use abbreviations for common words, with words
separate by underscore: "_".  Identifiers are all written in lower-case
ASCII.  

If a topic description requires a hyphen or dash (such as "Gram-Schmidt"
or "rank-nullity"), an ASCII dash "-" must be used.  Omit the dash in
the topic identifier.  For example:
id: math.la.t.mat.ranknullity
description: "Rank-nullity theorem."

No reference is made to R^n, C^n, or F^n, except as examples.  Instead,
we specify concepts as either being expressed in a "coordinate" vector
space or an "abstract" vector space.

Topic identifiers omit the "s" for a plural, even when the items being
described are plural.  For example:
id: math.la.d.mat.eig
description: "Definition of eigenvalue(s) of a matrix."

Available abbreviations are:

abs  abstract vector space
add  addition
charpoly  characteristic polynomial
coeff  coefficient
col  column
coord  coordinate vector space
det  determinant
dim  dimension
eig  eigenvalue(s)
eigvec  eigenvector(s)
eigsp  eigenspace(s)
eqn  equation
equiv  equivalent
homog  homogeneous
inv  inverse
lin  linear
lincomb  linear combination
lindep  linearly dependent
lineqn  linear equation
linindep  linearly independent
linsys  linear system
lintrans  linear transformation
mat  matrix
mult  multiplication
nonhomog  nonhomogeneous
op  operation
prod  product
repn  representation
rref  reduced row-echelon form
soln  solution
subsp  subspace
sys  system
vec  vector
vsp  vector space
z  zero
zoi  zero, one, or infinitely many

The topic identifiers mention objects before operations or properties, thus
sys.homog  not  homog.sys
mat.inv  not  inv.mat

If an item can be expressed in either a coordinate setting or an abstract
vector space setting, then both versions are available, with "coord" or "abs",
respectively, being the last entries in the identifiers.

Topic descriptions should start with a capital letter and end with a period
(even if the description is not technically a sentence).  The description should
be sufficiently expansive that the instructor of a typical linear algebra course
can easily discern the meaning.  The writing style should be appropriate for a
footnote in a scholarly publication.
