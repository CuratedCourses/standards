#  Linear Algebra topic list
#  Definitions, theorems, concepts and applications
#
#    description of a definition implicitly begins "definition of a"
#    equivalences might appear as both a theorem and definition
#      d.XX refers to a definition
#      t.YY refers to a theorem
#      c.ZZ refers to a concept
#      a.WW refers to an application
#
#    vector spaces
#      - "coordinate" is R^n, C^n, F^n
#      - "abstract" is any other space
#
#  Style Guide
#    * singular, as possible
#    * all lowercase
#    * no hyphens, spaces, or underscores
#
#  N.B.
#  (a) this file is not strictly YAML
#  (b) triple-dash *does* precede each id/description pair
#  (c) there needs to be more "subdivision"
#  (d) there needs to be more theorems and concepts
#  (e) more *common* applications would be welcome
