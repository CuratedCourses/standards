linear-algebra/outcomes

contains a reasonably complete list of outcomes for an introductory
course in linear algebra.  Example outcomes:

id: math.la.o.d.mat.inv
description: "Define the inverse of a matrix."
id: math.la.o.c.mat.inv
description: "Compute the inverse of a matrix."
id: math.la.o.b.mat.inv.det
description: "Describe the relationship between the determinant of a matrix and the determinant of its inverse."

All linear algebra outcomes begin with

math.la.o

Following math.la.o is one of the following letters, with the stated meaning:

a  Apply
b  Describe
c  Compute (or Calculate)
d  Define
e  Explain
f  Formulate
g  Recognize
h  Discuss
i  Interpret
j  Demonstrate
k  Find
l  List
m  Determine
n  Understand
o  Perform
p  Prove
q  Qualitatively describe
r  Relate
s  Solve
t  Translate
u  Use
v  Provide
w  Write
x  State
y  Identify
z  Analyze

The remaining parts of an outcome identifier follow the same pattern as the topic identifiers.
Implicit in the naming of outcome identifiers is that all outcomes are of the form "verb noun".

The description of an outcome must start with the corresponding word above.
