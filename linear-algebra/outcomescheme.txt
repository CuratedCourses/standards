linear-algebra/outcomes

contains a reasonably complete list of outcomes for an introductory
course in linear algebra.  Example outcomes:

id: math.la.o.kd.mat.inv
description: "Define the inverse of a matrix."
id: math.la.o.pc.mat.inv
description: "Compute the inverse of a matrix."
id: math.la.o.nz.mat.inv.det
description: "Derive the relationship between the determinant of a matrix and the determinant of its inverse."

All linear algebra outcomes begin with

math.la.o

Following math.la.o. is a pair of letters, where the first letter is one of the
following 6 choices, closely modeled on Bloom's taxonomy of objectives for
knowledge-based goals:

k  Knowledge
   State a definition, theorem, or formula.
   Use a specified theorem or formula in a restricted setting.

c  Comprehension
   Explain or paraphrase a definition or theorem.
   Use a specified theorem or formula in a less restricted setting

p  Application
   Apply an abstract/general method in a particular setting
   Solve routine word problems

n  Analysis
   Separate a complex idea into its constituent parts

s  Synthesis
   Derive an abstract relation.  Generalize a concept or combine
   multiple concepts

e  Evaluation
   Solve a problem where the methods required, or the nature of the
   solution, must be developed during the process of finding a solution

The possibilities for the second letter following math.la.o. is a function
of the first letter, as given below.

Note that the same verb can appear under more than one category,
The remaining parts of an outcome identifier follow the same pattern as the topic identifiers.
Implicit in the naming of outcome identifiers is that all outcomes are of the form "verb noun".

The description of an outcome must start with the corresponding word above.
